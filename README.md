# Workspace Development Kit

This repository contains some samples that can be used along with Workspace Web Edition :

- Workspace Toolkit
- WWE Service Client API

## Workspace Toolkit

Workspace Toolkit is a library of web components and JavaScript APIs for building custom agent web applications. It allows client developers to embed the same components that power PureEngage Workspace in their custom agent applications. Workspace Toolkit enables fast development with out-of-the-box functionality and reliability.

## WWE Service Client API

Service Client API can be use to customize how your web application or website integrates with Workspace Web Edition. This JavaScript API is based on window.postMessage and provides methods your application can use to communicate cross domain with Workspace Web Edition while maintaining secured isolation.
